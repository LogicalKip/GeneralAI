# GeneralAI
You say something to the AI, and the AI says or does something in response. Uses the awesome libraries SimpleNLG-EnFr and Stanford NLP.


Some libraries couldn't be pushed because they were too heavy. To be able to compile, please extract http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-parser-full-2015-12-09.zip, copy all .jar files in the lib folder and add them to the build path.
